# QuizGameBoolegans
Quiz Game fÃ¼r Teamarbeit

This is a very simple Quiz Game made with JavaFX and Gradle.
We used the OpenJDK 15.0.1, so if you are asked to select a JDK, download and select this one. (get it here: https://jdk.java.net/15/)

To start the project go to View -> Tool Windows -> Gradle. T

Then in the Window that pops up on the right Side click on the synchronise button. 
After it is fully synchronised, and you have downloaded Gradle, click on 
QuizGameBoolegans -> Tasks -> application -> then right click on run and press: Run 'QuizGameBoolegans ....'.

If everything is configured correctly the game should start :)
